I am from textbooks,
From Faber-Castell and Pilot.
I am from the small apartment with the sound of busy streets.
(Tiny, crowded, it smelled like fried dumplings.)
I am from the camphor trees,
The magnolia blossoms whose fragrance filled the spring air.

I'm from family dinners and hard work,
From Lin and Zhang.
I'm from the diligence and respect,
And from always finish your homework before playtime.
I'm from the Mid-Autumn Festival and the Lunar New Year,
From red lanterns and mooncakes.

I'm from "study hard to achieve your dreams" and "family comes first,"
From Shanghai and a long line of scholars.
I'm from baozi and xiaolongbao,
From the tales of my grandparents escaping the war.
The stories of resilience and perseverance,
Holding on to me across generations.

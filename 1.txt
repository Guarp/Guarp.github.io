I am from calligraphy brushes and pencils
From Li-Ning sneakers and Xiaomi backpacks
I am from the apartment with the red door
Cozy, bright, filled with the aroma of homemade dumplings
I am from the cherry blossom tree outside my window
Delicate and pink, symbolizing renewal and beauty
I'm from Lunar New Year celebrations and family reunions
From Grandfather Li and Aunt Mei
I'm from the ritual of morning tai chi and weekend trips to the countryside
From "Study hard and make your family proud"
I'm from ancestor worship during Qingming Festival with incense and paper offerings
I'm from Beijing and Han Chinese ancestry
Steamed buns and Peking duck
From the tale of Great-Grandma Lin, who traveled miles to teach children in rural villages

I am from notebooks and ink pens
From Li-Ning sneakers and Xiaomi backpacks
I am from the bustling and vibrant city apartment
Bright, energetic, smelling of mom's homemade dumplings
I am from the magnolia tree in the courtyard
Elegant and blossoming, symbolizing beauty and resilience
I'm from Chinese New Year celebrations and family game nights
From Aunt Mei and Cousin Wei
I'm from the routine of studying hard and taking evening walks along the Bund
From "Work hard, play hard" and "Respect your elders"
I'm from visiting the temple with incense and prayers
I'm from Shanghai and Chinese ancestry
Steamed buns and noodle soup
From the story of Great-Grandfather Liu, who moved to the city with dreams of a better life

I am from calligraphy brushes,
From Tsinghua pens and Beijing Stationery.
I am from the hutong with the echoes of laughter.
(Ancient, winding, it smelled like roasted duck.)
I am from the ginkgo trees,
The blooming peonies whose colors paint the spring.

I'm from morning exercises and tea ceremonies,
From Li and Wang.
I'm from the patience and wisdom,
And from always respect your elders.
I'm from the Dragon Boat Festival and the Spring Festival,
From zongzi and firecrackers.

I'm from "knowledge is the key to success" and "cherish your heritage,"
From Beijing and a lineage of artists.
I'm from jianbing and zhajiangmian,
From the tales of my ancestors building the Great Wall.
The stories of bravery and tradition,
Holding on to me across dynasties.

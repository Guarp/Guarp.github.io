Based on the provided "I Am From" poem template and the context of a Shanghai high school student, here's a draft poem:

Where I'm From

I am from rice steam,
rising in the quiet morning,
from green tea leaves and soy sauce stains.

I am from the skyscrapers,
(glass, steel, reaching skyward)
they reflect the bustling sounds of the city.

I am from the jasmine,
the cherry blossoms
whose delicate blooms mark the passage of spring.

I am from New Year fireworks and resilient dreams,
from Li and Wang.
I am from the scholars and the dreamers,
from "study hard" and "respect your elders."

From the tales of ancient dynasties,
and the wisdom of Confucius.
I'm from a mix of modernity and tradition,
from Buddha's teachings and the silent prayers.

I am from Shanghai,
city of quick rhythms and tranquil gardens,
from mooncakes and jiaozi,
symbolizing family unity during festive nights.

From the photos tucked away in old, worn albums,
each picture a story of generations past,
chronicling the rise from humble beginnings to vibrant city life.

I am from those momentsâ€”
captured on film,
preserved in memory,
linking me to the heartbeats of Shanghai.
